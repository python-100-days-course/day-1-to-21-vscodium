# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu
# Day 11 - Beginner - The Blackjack Capstone Project
# Difficulty - Hard 🤔: Use only Hints 1, 2, 3 to complete the project.

# Possible bugs/improvements:
# 1. If user has more than 11 (Ace), both will be replaced with 1 in case score is over 21?
# 2. Blackjack is a score of 21 with only 2 cards, curretly more than two cards can be "Blackjack", fixed
# 3. Code can probably be made simpler
